# Class Object Demo 03

Design a Credit Card class with a maximum limit of 500K. The class should allow cash withdrawals with a daily limit of 100K and a per-transaction limit of 20K.

For bill payments, there should be no limit as long as the total spending does not exceed the maximum limit of 500K.
